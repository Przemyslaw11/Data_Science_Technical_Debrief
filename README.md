# Data Science Intern - 2023 Summer Internship Program - CR

Problem Statement:
Suppose you're trying to help a company determine which computers to purchase. The company has been able to

pull utilization data by employee that classifies users into 3 bins, depending on how much they use their computer in

their work:

« Low usage - spends a lot of time in meetings, checking email, doing people management

« Average usage - requires some compute power, with balanced mix of heads down/technical work along with a
good amount of meetings/email writing

« High usage - power user, relies heavily on computer performance

Additionally, they've surveyed employees to collect the relative importance of the following variables describing a
computer's performance:

- Memory

- Processing

- Storage
- Price inverse - this metric was given to you by the company as you can see in the dataset, with the directive that

price inverse being fixed at a 25% weight in the purchase decision.

The results of the survey data can be found here.

Lastly, the company is looking to purchase a maximum of 3 different computer models, and have compiled the following
list scoring their memory, processing, storage, and relative price. Each dimension is scored from 0-10, with 10 being the
best.

Given this information, provide the company with a recommendation on which computers to purchase.
